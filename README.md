# Audio Transcription and Translation Script - Dependencies and Instructions

This document provides a step-by-step guide to install the required dependencies and run the script for transcribing and translating audio/video files. The script automatically detects the input language, transcribes the audio, and translates it into a user-selected output language.

---

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following Python libraries and tools. Below are the installation commands and explanations for each dependency.

---

### 1. **pydub**  
**Purpose**: Used for audio file manipulation and conversion (e.g., converting video/audio files to WAV format).  
**Installation Command**:  
```bash
pip install pydub
```  
**Explanation**: This command installs the `pydub` library, which is essential for handling audio files in the script. It allows the script to convert audio/video files into WAV format for processing.

---

### 2. **SpeechRecognition**  
**Purpose**: Used for transcribing audio to text using Google's speech recognition API.  
**Installation Command**:  
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
```  
**Explanation**: This command installs the `SpeechRecognition` library, which is used to convert audio chunks into text. The library uses Google's speech recognition API, so an internet connection is required.

---

### 3. **googletrans==4.0.0-rc1**  
**Purpose**: Used for translating text from one language to another (e.g., English to Arabic or German).  
**Installation Command**:  
```bash
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```  
**Explanation**: This command installs a specific version of the `googletrans` library, which is used for translation. The version `4.0.0-rc1` is recommended to avoid compatibility issues. The library relies on Google Translate, so an internet connection is required.

---

### 4. **langdetect**  
**Purpose**: Used for automatically detecting the language of the transcribed text.  
**Installation Command**:  
```bash
pip install langdetect
```  
**Explanation**: This command installs the `langdetect` library, which helps the script automatically identify the input language of the audio. It analyzes the transcribed text to determine the most likely language.

---

### 5. **ffmpeg** (External Dependency)  
**Purpose**: Required by `pydub` for handling various audio file formats (e.g., MP4, MP3, etc.).  
**Installation Instructions**:  
- **Ubuntu/Debian**:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```  
  **Explanation**: This command installs `ffmpeg` on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems using the system package manager.  

- **macOS** (with Homebrew):  
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```  
  **Explanation**: This command installs `ffmpeg` on macOS using Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS.  

- **Windows**:  
  Download and install from [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).  
  **Explanation**: On Windows, you need to manually download and install `ffmpeg` from its official website.

## How to Install All Dependencies

Run the following command to install all Python dependencies in one go:  
```bash
pip install pydub SpeechRecognition googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 langdetect
```  
**Explanation**: This command installs all the required Python libraries (`pydub`, `SpeechRecognition`, `googletrans`, and `langdetect`) in one step. Make sure `ffmpeg` is also installed on your system.

---

## How to Run the Script

1. **Place Your Audio/Video File**:  
   Place your audio or video file (e.g., `video.mp4`) in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Execute the script using the following command:  
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```  
   **Explanation**: Replace `script.py` with the actual name of your Python script. The script will automatically detect the input language and transcribe the audio.

3. **Select the Output Language**:  
   The script will prompt you to select the output language for translation. Choose from the following options:  
   - `1` for German  
   - `2` for Arabic  

4. **Generated Files**:  
   The script will generate two SRT files:  
   - `subtitles_original.srt`: Contains the transcribed text in the original language.  
   - `subtitles_<language>.srt`: Contains the translated text in the selected output language (e.g., `subtitles_ar.srt` for Arabic).

---

## Example Output

```
Audio extracted: temp_audio.wav
Transcribing audio in chunks...
Detected input language: en
Select the output language:
1. German
2. Arabic
Enter the number corresponding to the output language: 2
Translating transcriptions to ar...
Original SRT file generated: subtitles_original.srt
Translated SRT file generated: subtitles_ar.srt
```

---

## Notes

- **Internet Connection**: The script requires an active internet connection for speech recognition and translation.  
- **Language Detection**: The `langdetect` library may not always be 100% accurate. If the detected language is incorrect, you may need to manually specify the input language in the script.  
- **Translation Quality**: The quality of translation depends on Google Translate. For better results, ensure the transcribed text is accurate.  

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation Issues**: If you encounter issues while installing `googletrans`, try upgrading the library or using an alternative translation API.  
- **FFmpeg Errors**: Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed correctly and added to your system's PATH.  
- **Speech Recognition Errors**: If transcription fails, check your internet connection or try reducing the audio chunk size.
